# AutoMasterLooter
1.12.1 + Turtle wow Addon that automatically assigns loot to the masterlooter
- Turn on by typing "/AutoML" or "/AutoMasterLooter"
- While masterlooter of a dungeon or raid group and the addon is turned on, your character will automatically assign all non-soulbound loot to itself. There is no warning or confirmation window.
- You can add non-soulbound items to an exclusion list that stops your character from autolooting them, or you can add soulbound items to an "always loot" list that makes your character autoloot them even though they're soulbound. This is customized by editing the Lua file of the addon. There's no graphic interface or chat commands, learn to code.
- Upon detecting an epic item on the mob, it will send a warning in chat and play a sound. Default sound is auction house close ding, the user can change it from within the .lua file.
